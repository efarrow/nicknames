Discover and replace names, nicknames, and misspellings

Code to support the discovery and replacement of personal names,
including nicknames and misspellings within the text of informal
messages exchanged in asynchronous online discussions, as described in
the paper ["Names, Nicknames, and Spelling Errors: Protecting
Participant Identity in Learning Analytics of Online Discussions"][1].

The file `example_script.txt` shows the commands to reproduce the
analysis and results from the paper.

The file `textwash_wrapper.py` provides a wrapper for the [Textwash
system](https://github.com/maximilianmozes/textwash). The Textwash
code must be installed separately.
